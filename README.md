# ‚úàÔ∏è Joteks Travels ‚Äì Containerized Website on AWS

Joteks Travels is a fully containerized static website built to showcase travel destinations and services, developed using Docker and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with EC2 and ECS (Fargate).  

This project demonstrates practical skills in **containerization, cloud infrastructure deployment, and DevOps workflows**, making it a strong portfolio example for aspiring Cloud & DevOps engineers.  

Visitors can explore a visually engaging travel website, while the project itself highlights modern deployment practices including **local Docker builds, version-controlled GitHub repositories, AWS EC2 hosting, container orchestration with ECS, and optional integration with an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.  

By completing this project, you‚Äôll see a full **end-to-end workflow from local development to cloud deployment**, illustrating how to efficiently package, deploy, and manage containerized applications on AWS.
